# Graduation Analysis: College Student Outcomes

This project explores the relationship between graduation outcomes and various demographic, academic, and enrollment-related factors using real-world data from `collegeData.csv`. We conduct both **hypothesis testing** and **association tests** to evaluate statistically significant differences between students who graduate and those who do not.
