# QB 2022 Linear Regression Project

This project uses linear regression (both manually using Numpy and via scikit-learn) to predict a quarterback's rating based on their completion percentage for the 2022 NFL season.

# Task Summary
- Implemented linear regression with matrix algebra
- Used scikit-learn's LinearRegression
- Predicted Patrick Mahomes' rating
- Calculated squared error from actual rating

# Built with
